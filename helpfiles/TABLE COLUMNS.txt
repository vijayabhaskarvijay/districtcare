Here's a summary of My project idea and the database details:

Project Idea:
My project is called "UrbanLink," and it aims to create a platform that connects the public, NGO's, government staff, and administrators to facilitate communication and address various issues in different locations. The platform allows users to create and view posts based on their roles, such as public posts, NGO posts, government posts, and admin posts. Users can also report other users if they find any inappropriate content or activities.

the public can register themselves in the portal through an safe registration form where their personal details and their location will be retrieved
and then then user will login , after successful authentication they will be taken to public user landing page where they can will be able to see 
the public post,amin post, govn pos, ngo post and in landing page there will be many link to redirect one is profile where the user can manage 
their profile next is post creation where the public can do public post and then public problem reporting page where the users can report their 
problem in their residential areas in an detailed manner included with an map integration where the user can mark the accurate location of the 
problem and then the problem related department and problem type and problem description everything will be collected from the user and be saved 
in the database properly , then they can manage the post that was created by them and then they can track the status of the problem reported by 
them and based on processed by either by the govn or by an ngo they can provide feedback to them, next moving to government side the govn staff
will login by entering their credentials and based on the location chosen and department of the govn staff working those related problems only be
displayed to the related government staff and they can update the status of the problem and they can mark that the problem is going to get 
solved by the government so that ngo who can see this in their page need not to work on the same problem as that will be resolved by the 
government , then the government can manage the fund that wa raised by the ngo to work on the issues reported by the user and govn can see the 
feedback given by the user so that they can improve their side works in an effective way and in the ngo side they can see the problem based on 
their location and then they can update the processing by as NGO that means the particular problem will be solved by the NGO ,government need not 
to be involved in that, if the ngo needs funds in their side, they can request fund to the government staff based on the department and the 
problem type and on the city where the problem resided, so that the fund will be arranged by the government based after verification from their 
side and the ngo can see the feedback provided by the user based on the work carried out by the ngo that impressed the public user who reported 
the problem, the admin is the main control panel who can control everything, in public side the user will have separate page to see the status and 
if any unusual or violated or bad post posted by any user means that will be reported by the other public user who finds it wrong that will be 
managed by the admin separately in their side and if they find that the post is wrong or violated or abusive etc.. the admin will block that 
particular user account who posted that post, everything page and details are neatly structure no security issues will be able  to happen and 
this helps the public user to involve in improving their community and then can get more belief on the government as every process is transparent 
to the user and the users will be benefitted with the public post where many useful details across places can be shared like events, near area 
problems, donations , job alerts, news etc.. can be shared and the users can be benefited by this portal
